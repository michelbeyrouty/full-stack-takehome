# Developing MaintainX take-home project
This is a small documentation to explain the development process that was done to deliver the project.
Also i will be mentioning enhancments that we could use.

## Planning project

The first step was to go through the instruction and create relevant tickets. I used github projects to keep track of my progress and TODOs. You can find the details (here)[https://github.com/users/michelbeyrouty/projects/1]

## Start Project
Run these commands to start the project locally:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Possible enhacments for the project:

- Use proper logging Library instead of simply using console.log

- Add functional tests
- Add pagination
