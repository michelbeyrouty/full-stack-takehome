# Developing MaintainX take-home project
This is a small documentation to explain the development process that was done to deliver the project.
Also i will be mentioning enhancments that we could use.

## Planning project

The first step was to go through the instruction and create relevant tickets. I used github projects to keep track of my progress and TODOs. You can find the details (here)[https://github.com/users/michelbeyrouty/projects/1]

## Possible enhancments
Possible enhacments for thsi project:

- Use proper logging Library instead of simply using console.log
- Add versioning to routes `/api/v1`
- Use [http-status-codes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-status-codes) 3rd party library for status codes
- Add functional tests

## Notes
- Added delay on frontend to showcase async components
